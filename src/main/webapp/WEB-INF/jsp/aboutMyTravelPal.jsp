	 myTravelPal is a calendar view of my travel plans. Developed using fullcalendar plugin, 
	 myTravelPal runs on mongodb with spring boot. Travel plans are fed into the system using a simple form.
	 The form captures the travel mode, type, purpose/description of the travel, start and end time of the
	 travel. One can customize the application for their own needs. For now, this application is show-casing 
	 my travel plans.
